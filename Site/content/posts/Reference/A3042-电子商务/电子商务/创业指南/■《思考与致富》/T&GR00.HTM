      <p> <span class="englishtext">这以后的每一章都会提到赚钱的秘诀，遵循它的指引，已 产生出成百上千的巨富，赚进了无数的钱财。许久以来，这些 
        富商巨贾一直是我详尽分析的对象。<br>
        In every chapter of this book,mention has been made of the money-making 
        secret which has made fortunes for hundreds of exceedingly wealthy men 
        whom I have carefully analyzed over a long period of years. </span></p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 50多年前，卡内基先生最先让我注意到这个致富秘诀。 当时我还只不过是个男孩子，这位精明干练而慈祥的苏格兰老 
        人，却满不在乎地把这个诀窍抛入我脑海，然后就背靠着座 椅，眼中闪烁着快乐的光芒，留神地看我到底有没有足够的智 力去领会他所有的含意。<br>
        The secret was brought to my attention by Andrew Carnegie, more than half 
        a century ago. The canny, lovable old Scotsman carelessly tossed it into 
        my mind, when I was but a boy. Then be sat back in his chair, with a merry 
        twinkle in his eyes, and watched carefully to see if I had brains enough 
        to understand the full significance of what he had said to me. </p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 他发现到我拿握住了他的观念，就又问我，愿不愿意花上 幼年或者更多年的时间，让自己成一点气候，再将这则窍门 
        公诸于世，让原本可能终其一生碌碌无为的男男女女皆可因此 受惠?我说我愿意。于是，在卡内基先生的协助下，我一直信 守着当时的承诺。<br>
        When he saw that I bad grasped the idea. he asked if I would be willing 
        to spend twenty years or more preparing myself to take it to the would, 
        to men and women who, without the secret, might go through life as failures. 
        I said I would, and with Mr. Carnegie's cooperation, I have kept my promise. 
      </p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 书中这则绝妙上策已有上千人屡试不爽，这些人遍及社会 的各个阶层。卡内基先生当初的用意是，对于为他带来巨额财 
        富的这则神奇公式，应该让没有闲暇探究生财之道的人，也能垂手可得。他也希望我能在不同行业的男女身上，验征这则公 式究竟靠不靠得住。他认为这则公式应该在所有的公立院校传 
        授。他更表示，如果讲授得宜，这个法则足以引发整个教育体 系的彻底改革，大家可因此少花一半的时间在学校的课程上。<br>
        This book contains the secret, after having been put to a practical test 
        by thousands of people, in almost every walk of life. It was Mr. Carnegie's 
        idea that the magic formula, which gave him a stupendous fortune, ought 
        to be placed within reach of people who do not have time to investigate 
        how men make money, and it was his hope that I might test and demonstrate 
        the soundness of the formula through the experience of men and women in 
        every calling. He believed the formula should be taught in all public 
        schools and colleges, and expressed the opinion that if it were properly 
        taught it would so revolutionize the entire educational system that the 
        time spent in school could be reduced to less than half. </p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 在讨论信心的那一章里，你会读到美国钢铁公司令人惊讶 的建构史。原因在于，一手孕育缔造这则传奇故事的人，便是卡内基先生亲自调教出来的诸多年轻人中的一员，借着这些年 
        轻人的成绩，卡内基先生证明了这则窍门“对那些已准备就绪 的人来说”都会有效。史库韦伯运用了这则秘诀一次，就为自 己赚进了大把钞票，并赢得数不完的机会。这次的运筹惟惧， 
        少说也值6亿美金。<br>
        In the chapter on Faith, you will read the astounding story of the organization 
        of the giant United States Steel Corporation, as it was conceived and 
        carried out by one of the young men through whom Mr. Carnegie proved that 
        his formula will work for all who are ready for it. This single application 
        of the secret, by Charles M. Schwab, made him a huge fortune in both money 
        and opportunity. Roughly speaking, this particular application of the 
        formula was worth six hundred million dollars. </p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 这些事实是每一个认识卡内基先生的人都耳熟能详的。上述的实例可以让你大略了解到， “只要你知道自己要的是什 
        么”，这本书便可以为你罗致什么。<br>
        These facts--and they are facts well known to almost everyone who knew 
        Mr. Carnegie--give you a fair idea of what the reading of this book may 
        bring to you, provided you know what it is that you want. </p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 这个秘诀已传授给上千名男女，正如卡内基先生所预期 的，这些男女将这个原则运用在自身的利害关系上，其中一些 
        人发了财，有些则成功地营造了家庭的和乐融洽。有位传教士 因为运用此诀得当，年收入高达7．5万美元，并且有增无减呢! <br>
        The secret was passed on to thousands of men and women who have used it 
        for their personal benefit as Mr. Carnegie planned that they should. Some 
        have made fortunes with it. Other have used it successfully in creating 
        harmony in their homes. A clergyman used it so effectively that it brought 
        him an income of upwards of $75,OOO a year.</p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 辛辛那提的一位裁缝师亚瑟・纳斯扭他濒临破产的事业拿 来当作“实验用白鼠”，想看看这个法则灵不灵光，结果他的 
        事业又起死回生，并因此发了大财。虽然亚瑟・纳斯先生已去 世，这家公司还是欣欣向荣。这次的实验简直无可比拟，报章 杂志争相传诵的溢美之辞，为公司免费打了价值逾百万美元的 
        广告。 <br>
        Arthur Nash, a Cincinnati tailor, used his near-bankrupt business as a 
        &quot;guinea pig&quot; on which to test the formula. The business came 
        to life and made a fortune for its owners. It is still thriving, although 
        Mr. Nash has gone. The experiment was so unique that newspapers and magazines 
        gave it more than a million dollars' worth of laudatory publicity.</p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 这个诀窍也被魏尔所得知。当时他住在德州的达拉斯，而 且他万事俱各，只欠东风，于是一口气辞了职，改行学法律。 
        他成功了吗?这个故事本书中就会提到。<br>
        The secret was passed on to Stuart Austin Wier, of Dallas, Texas. He was 
        ready for it--so ready that he gave up his profession and studied law. 
        Did he succeed? That story is told, too. </p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 我在拉萨尔推广大学当宣传经理时，该校才刚草创不久， 规模粗具，我有幸得以眼见校长查别林善用这个公式，而使该校投济身全美的大型推广院校之列。我所指的这个秘诀，将在书 
        里前前后后提到不下百次。这则公式并没有支截了当的名称， 因为不命名似乎比较灵验，那些一切皆已就绪、正在四下摸索 的人仍可以俯拾皆得。所以当初卡内基先生传授这个概念给我 
        时，也没跟我讲到什么特别的名称，只是悄悄传递了一个概念 给我罢了。<br>
        While serving as advertising manager of the LaSalle Extension University, 
        when it was little more than a name, I had the privilege of seeing J. 
        G. Chapline, president of the university, use the formula so effectively 
        that he made LaSalle one of the great extension schools of the country.The 
        secret to which I refer has been mentioned no fewer than a hundred times 
        throughout this book. It has not been directly named, for it seems to 
        work more successfully when it is merely uncovered and left in sight, 
        where those who are ready, and searching for it, may pick it up. That 
        is why Mr. Carnegie tossed it to me so quietly, without giving me its 
        specific name. </p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 如果你已准备好，要把这个公式派上用场，在本书的每一 章里，你至少可以找到一次这则窍门。我很希望我能亲自告诉 
        你如何运用这个秘诀，但是你用自己的方法去找答案，受用会 更大。<br>
        If you are ready to put it to use, you will recognize this secret at least 
        once in every chapter. I wish I might feel privileged to tell you how 
        you will know if you are ready, but that would deprive you of much of 
        the benefit yon will receive when you make the discovery in your own way.</p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 如果你曾经气馁挫败过，如果你曾竭尽心力熬过图厄，如 果你曾很努力却失败了，如果你因病痛导致行动不便，本书可 
        能正是你遍寻不看的荒漠甘泉。 <br>
        If you have ever been discouraged. if you have had difficulties to surmount 
        which took the very soul out of you, if you have tried and failed, if 
        you were ever handicapped by illness or physical affection, the &quot;story 
        of my son's discovery and use of the Carnegie formula may prove to be 
        ale oasis in the Desert of Lost Hope for which you have been searching. 
      </p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 第一次世界大战期间，咸尔逊总统曾大力运用本秘诀。每 一位参战的士兵受训时，都接受了不露痕迹、精心包装在训练 
        课程里的这个秘诀，然后才到前线去作战。威尔逊总统告诉 我，在筹募作战经费时，这个秘诀也居功甚伟。<br>
        This &quot;secret was extensively used by Resident Woodrow Wilson during 
        World War I. It was passed on to every soldier who fought in the war, 
        carefully wrapped in the training received before going to the front. 
        President Wilson told me it was a strong factor in raising the funds needed 
        for the war. </p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 这个秘诀的特殊之处是，一旦展现在已得知它、使用它的 人身上，他们旋即一一致富。如果你心存怀疑，每当我提到某 
        些人的名字，你就可以去研究一下这些曾运用此道的人；你可 以亲自去查明求征，然后你就会心服口服。<br>
        A peculiar thing about this secret is that those who once acaerie it and 
        use it, find themselves literally swept on to success. If you doubt this, 
        study the names of those who have used it, wherever they have been mentioned; 
        check their records for yourself, and be convinced. </p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 天下是没有不劳而获这回事的! <br>
        There is no such thing as something for nothing! </p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 我提出的这个秘诀，是要付出代价才能取得的，但是它物 超所值太多了。对那些不曾刻意手觅成功诀窍的人来说，花再大代价，也学不来这个窍门。这个公式既不能免费奉送，也不 
        能用金钱买卖，因为这个秘诀分为两个部分。其中一部分，是 那些一切就绪的人身上原已具备的。 The secret to which I refer 
        cannot be had without a price, although the price is far less than its 
        value. It cannot be had at any price by those who are not intentionally 
        searching for it.it cannot be given away, it cannot be purchased for money, 
        for the reason that it comes in two parts. One part is already in possession 
        of those who are ready for it. </p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 对所有准备就绪的人来说，这则诀窍的效力是不会因人而 异的。这个成功法则和教育程度一点关系也没有。早在我呱呱 
        坠地之前许久，爱迪生即巳坐事这个成功要诀，并且加以发扬 光大，使自己成为世界首屈一指的发明大师，而他只上过3个月的学校。<br>
        The secret serves equally well all who are ready for it. Education has 
        nothing to do with it. Long before I was born, the secret had found its 
        way into the possession of Thomas A. Edison, and he used it so intelligently 
        that he became the world's leading inventor, although he had but three 
        months of schooling.</p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 爱迪生的事业伙伴艾德温・巴纳斯也颇请此道。虽然他当 时的年收入仅有1．2万美元，他仍迅速累积了一大笔财富，而 
        且以壮年之姿功成身退，隐身于繁忙的幕前作业之后。你将会 在第一章开头就读到他的传奇。你一定会发现，成功并非遥不 可及，你仍然可以成为自己所向往的人物，名和利、幸福和认 
        同一切近在眼前，只要心态正确，下定决心的人都可以得享这个福分。<br>
        The secret was passed on to Edwin C. Bames, a business associate of Mr. 
        Edison. He used it so effectively that, although he was then making only 
        $12,OOO a year, he accumulated a great fortune, and retired from active 
        business while still a young man. You will find his story at the beginning 
        of the first chapter. It should convince you that riches are not beyond 
        your reach, that you can still be what yon wish to be, that money, fame, 
        recognition and happiness can be had by all who are ready and determined 
        to have these blessings. </p>
      <p class="englishtext"> 我是怎么跟这些福分结缘的?你还没读完这本书就可能找 到答案了。也可能才读了开宗明义的第一章，你就已恍然大 
        悟，也可能读完最后一页，你才开窍。<br>
        How do I know these things? You should have the answer before you finish 
        this book. You may find it in the very first chapter, or on the last page.

        教育究竟是什么?这个问题我会详加解答。<br>
        These names represent but a small fraction of the hundreds of well-known 
        Americans whose achievements, financial and otherwise, prove that those 
        who understand and apply the Carnegie secret reach high stations in life. 
        I have never known anyone who was inspired to use the secret who did not 
        achieve noteworthy success in his chosen calling. I have never known any 
        person to distinguish himself, or to accumulate riches of any consequence, 
        without possession of the secret. From these two facts I draw the conclusion 
        that the secret is more important as a part of the knowledge essential 
        for self-determination, than any which one receives through what is popularly 
        known as &quot;education.&quot; What is education anyway? This has been 
        answered in full detail.</p>

        achievement, all earned riches, have their beginning in an idea! If you 
        are ready for the secret you already possess one half of it;therefore,you
